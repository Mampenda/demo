Gradle is the open source build system of choice for Java, Android, and Kotlin developers.

## Installation

## Sign-up page
I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EQyWl5cHjc) to create the sign-up page.
I also used some scripts which can be found in the links added [here](https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js) and [here](https://unpkg.com/ionicons@7.1.0/dist/ionicons/ionicons.js),
and I imported the [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) font-family from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## User login and registration
